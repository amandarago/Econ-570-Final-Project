    "I would assume by now that nearly every single person knows someone close to them that has been affected by cancer. Cancer research is something that has been going on for an extremely long time, but to no avail for a cure. It is a horrible disease that is incredibly painful for those with it. It's quite obvious as to why cancer research is important. \n"

    "I found the data used through the sources the Professor included in the assignment; specifically, it is from data world. The creator of the data sourced it through cancer.gov, clinicaltrials.gov, and census.gov. \n",
    "The edits I made to the data was I removed all of the rows that had empty cells in them because this was effecting my attempts at using WLS. I did not remove any outliers and am not doing any sampling restrictions. I am planning to just utilize the variables in the data and see how they interact with the dependent variable in the regression. Also, I did not append other data sets because the one I am using is quite extensive to begin with, and in itself is created from multiple different government sources. "

    "Literature/Research: The data I gathered this from used it for regression analysis as well, so there is that in terms of previous work on the subject. While researching for other material on the matter of cancer death rate and ols regression, I came across this website https://www.rpubs.com/usnf002/ols_challenge where Steven Burnett actually used the same dataset I am. Burnett only used OLS for their model. The difference between mine and Burnett is that Burnett wanted to predict cancer mortality rates, whereas I am using OLS to identify factors that have the greatest effect on cancer mortality rate. I also want to note (although slightly irrelevant) that Burnett's work was done in R opposed to Python. \n",
    "More similar to my goals of findings was this paper by Shannon M. Stare and James J. Jozefowicz titled, \"The Effects of Environmental Factors on Cancer Prevalence Rates and Specific Cancer Mortality Rates in a Sample of OECD Developed Countries\". I say it is similar to mine only because they are looking at the regression results to interpret which factors of their model have a large effect on different types of cancer. Similar to me, they use OLS and WLS models. They extend their research beyond just general cancer rates, but specific environmental factors that are statistically significant for different types of cancer, which I found to be interesting. Their methods are well detailed and their results, in my opinion, are interpreted well. The link to their works is: http://conferencenow.info/yhsing/applied-economics-journals/ARCHIVE/ijae/index_files/IJAE%20SEPT%202008%20STARE%20JOZEFOWICZ%2010-24-08%20Cancer%20Paper%20-%20IJAE%20-%20Final.pdf"

    "   I'm actually surprised to see that povertyPercent isn't significant. I would have thought that it would have a much greater effect on mortality rate since it is known that those living in poverty tend to have a harder time with their health. The median income being significant goes along with my thoughts about poverty, and the sign of this parameter makes sense. It can be interpreted as 100 unit increase in the median income for the county would cause a 0.05 reduction in the cancer mortalities. Also, median age is seen to be statistically significant, and it's sign also makes sense. Basically, a 10 year increase in the median age would increase the cancer mortalities by 0.288 which makes sense because older people tend to have a harder time beating cancer. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Interesting is the significance of the percentage of private coverage. This parameter shows that a 10% increase in the percent of county residents with private health coverage leads to a 9.6 reduction of cancer mortality. Makes sense because private health coverage is seen to be better than public health coverage. Furthermore on health coverage, a 10% increase in the percent of those with employee-provided health coverage actually would cause an increase in cancer mortality of 34.1; I don't actually understand why this would be the case since it is private health coverage. I would be interested to do further research on this. What does make sense though is the 27 unit increase in cancer mortality with a 10% increase in the percent of people with public coverage, again because it is seen to be not great. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   It can be seen that both the variables representing the white and black population are statistically significant. These results claim that a 10% increase in the squared percent of the white population reduces cancer mortality by 0.032. A 10% increase in the cubed percent of the black population reduces cancer mortality by 0.001. I would have expected one of these to be positive and one to be negative, but I suppose it can be interperted that a whiter population has an even lower cancer mortality rate than a black population. A 10% increase in the population of \"other race\" has the highest reduction in cancer mortality out of the statistically significant groups, being that it would cause a 22 unit reduction. \n",

    "   Overall, the study is claiming that a county with a population that is majority young, wealthy, with private health insurance and considered \"other race\" will have the lowest cancer related mortalities. \n",

    "   Since WLS conducts parameter estimation by minimizing the sum of squared errors, it is somewhat delicate when it comes outliers. Basically, it is not very robust if outliers were to be introduced. If there were known outliers that weren't removed from the data, a different more robust method would need to be utilized for the regression because WLS is not equipped to stand up to them. The least squares methods as a whole are not very robust."

    "From this analysis, it can be seen that a weighted model is better than OLS in order to help reduce the effects of heteroscedasticity. This will provide more efficient estimates and I'm pretty sure that because I did not randomly choose a weight but I used FGLS to obtain the weight, the estimates are less biased (or even unbiased) than OLS estimates. I do recognize though that there is still plenty of improvement to my model, perhaps taking out some variables, or including more (hopefully without at the cost of precision). Also, it could be useful to not use the square or cube of some factors, but just the values themselves. With modeling, there is a lot of trial and error. This is the model I was most confident with though. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, questions about the type of health coverage that actually has more of an effect could be researched. As mentioned above, I find it strange the just because the private insurance was provided by an employee, it caused a reduction. I would like to know why this is the case. I would also like to know why an increase in any of the races (except asian because it was not seen to be statistically significant) caused a reduction in the mortality. It seems to me that at least one of them would cause an increase, but all we're seeing is a larger reduction vs a smaller reduction, which is still of interest. Furthermore, this dataset included information about highschool and colleges, but I think it would be even more interesting to include information of private educaiton. This would help researchers know that if a private education environment has some sort of effect. These variables would though obviously be connected to income, but to still have a model with just education could be interesting. Lastly, I think the inclusion of variables representing alcoholism, substance abuse, and even air quality would be a more scientific approach to the data. These would help draw conclusions about the hopeful prevention of cancer and not just the mere facts (that are somewhat uncontrollable, i.e. race) of cancer mortality. "
